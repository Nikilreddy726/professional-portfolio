# Nikil Portfolio (Next.js App Router)

This is a Next.js 14 App Router starter built from your provided components and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000

## Notes
- Components use client-side features (Framer Motion, hooks), so many files have `use client`.
- The `components/ui` folder contains minimal wrappers for Button/Input/Textarea so the project runs without external shadcn dependency. You can replace them with shadcn components later.
